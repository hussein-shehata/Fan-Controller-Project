# Fan-Controller-Project
This project used Atmega16 as a Microcontroller. the project used LM35 sensor to measure the temperature. 
The goal of the project is to make the fan change the fan change its speed according to the temperature of the room sensed by the LM35 sensor and it displays the tempurature of the Room on LCD 16x2.
I used Eclipse to Write and build the project and proteus as simulation tool.
